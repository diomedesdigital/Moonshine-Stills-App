			<ion-card-content>
				<p>8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged electric heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.</p>
			</ion-card-content>
		</ion-card>	
		<ion-card>
			<ion-card-content>
				<p>9. MASH= fermented materials that can range from anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Vol'ume) The higher the ABV the more akohot you wilJ be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the Mash with your Moonshine Still. VISIT WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY RECIPES TO GET STARTED You are going to need a Hydrometer whfch measures the alcohol continent of the Mash, cause it's always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and end of the process. There are two different types of hydrometer 1 to use for low proof (of Mash) and 1 for high proof Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us</p>

		</ion-card>	
		<ion-card>
			<ion-card-content>
				<p>10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal cap of the pot with old school Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit good. The Thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning do not add anything 1n it) unti'l you 'know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.</p>
			</ion-card-content>
		</ion-card>	
		<ion-card>
			<ion-card-content>
				<p>11. Your worm the one with coil needs a constant flow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get a upgraded thumper an worm kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.</p>
			</ion-card-content>
		</ion-card>
		<ion-card>
			<ion-card-content>
				<p>12. Put a flame underneath pot until the unit starts to "work" as soon as the worm is dripping product write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it "that is your operating range" Always keep still within this range to make sure H20 does not go into your product.</p>
			</ion-card-content>
		</ion-card>
		<ion-card>
			<ion-card-content>
				<p>13. Your Thumper will fill up with liquid an eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper content's or save and re-run in your next batch.</p>
			</ion-card-content>
		</ion-card>	
		<ion-card>
			<ion-card-content>
				<p>14. Do not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do appropriate research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.</p>
